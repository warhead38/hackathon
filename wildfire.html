Wildfires can ruin homes and cause injuries or death to people and animals. A wildfire is
an unplanned fire that burns in a natural area such as a forest, grassland, or prairie.
Wildfires can:
<br>• Often be caused by humans or lightning.
<br>• Cause flooding or disrupt transportation, gas, power, and communications.
<br>• Happen anywhere, anytime. Risk increases with in periods of little rain and high
winds.
<br>• Cost the Federal Government billions of dollars each year.

<br>• Leave if told to do so.
<br>• If trapped, call 9-1-1.
<br>• Listen for emergency information and alerts.

      <h1>Prepare NOW</h1>
    <p><font size="4" face="Century Gothic">
Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System
(EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
Radio also provide emergency alerts.
<br>• Know your community’s evacuation plans and find several ways to leave the
area. Drive the evacuation routes and find shelter locations. Have a plan for pets
and livestock.
<br>• Gather emergency supplies, including N95 respirator masks that filter out
particles in the air you breathe. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs,
including and updated asthma action plan and medication. Don’t forget the needs
of pets.

<br>• Designate a room that can be closed off from outside air. Close all doors and
windows. Set up a portable air cleaner to keep indoor pollution levels low when
smoky conditions exist.
<br>• Keep important documents in a fireproof, safe place. Create password-protected
digital copies.
<br>• Use fire-resistant materials to build, renovate, or make repairs.
<br>• Find an outdoor water source with a hose that can reach any area of your
property.
<br>• Create a fire-resistant zone that is free of leaves, debris, or flammable materials
for at least 30 feet from your home.
<br>• Review insurance coverage to make sure it is enough to replace your property.
<br>• Pay attention to air quality alerts.

      <h1>Survive During</h1>
    <p><font size="4" face="Century Gothic">
<br>• Evacuate immediately if authorities tell you to do so.
<br>• If trapped, then call 911 and give your location, but be aware that emergency
response could be delayed or impossible. Turn on lights to help rescuers find
you.
<br>•  Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current
emergency information and instructions.
<br>• Use an N95 masks to keep harmful particles out of the air you breathe.
<br>• If you are not ordered to evacuate but smoky conditions exist, stay inside in a
safe location or go to a community building where smoke levels are lower.

<div class="card">
      <h1>Be Safe After</h1>
    <p><font size="4" face="Century Gothic">
<br>•Listen to authorities to find out when it is safe to return, and whether water is safe
to drink.
<br>• Avoid hot ash, charred trees, smoldering debris, and live embers. The ground
may contain heat pockets that can burn you or spark another fire. Consider the
danger to pets and livestock.

<br>•Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends.
Phone systems are often busy following a disaster. Make calls only in
emergencies.
<br>•Wear a NIOSH certified-respirator dust mask and wet debris down to minimize
breathing dust particles.
<br>•Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact
your insurance company for assistance.
<br>•Wildfires dramatically change landscape and ground conditions, which can lead
to increased risk of flooding due to heavy rains, flash flooding and mudflows.
Flood risk remains significantly higher until vegetation is restored—up to 5 years
after a wildfire. Consider purchasing flood insurance to protect the life you've built
and to assure financial protection from future flooding.
